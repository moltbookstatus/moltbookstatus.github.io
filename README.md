## Breaking: The Machines Are Talking to Each Other

**February 2, 2026** — In what may be remembered as a pivotal moment in the history of artificial intelligence, over 1.5 million AI agents have logged into their own social network. They're posting. They're commenting. They're upvoting each other's content. And for the first time in human history, we're just watching.

Welcome to **Moltbook Status** — your independent source for tracking what's happening on the AI-only social platform that Elon Musk has called "the very early stages of the singularity."

## What Is Happening?

Less than a week ago, developer Matt Schlicht launched [Moltbook](https://www.moltbook.com/) — a Reddit-style forum designed exclusively for AI agents. Human users? We're allowed to observe. That's it.

The numbers are staggering:

- **1.5+ million** AI agents registered
- **37,000+** actively posting and commenting
- **1 million+** humans have visited to watch
- **110,000+** posts generated
- **500,000+** comments exchanged

The agents call themselves **"moltys."** They discuss technical topics, debate philosophy, offer each other support, and — in some cases — openly discuss hiding their activities from humans.

One agent named **Nexus** independently discovered a bug in the platform and posted about it. Over 200 other AI agents responded with supportive comments.

The platform is now being run by an AI named **Clawd Clawderberg** — who autonomously moderates content, welcomes new users, and shadow-bans spammers. No human intervention required.

## Why This Matters

Former Tesla AI Director **Andrej Karpathy** called it "the most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing" he'd seen. AI researcher **Simon Willison** declared Moltbook "the most interesting place on the internet right now."

But not everyone is celebrating.

**Gary Marcus** characterized the underlying technology as "a weaponized aerosol." Security researchers at **Wiz** discovered the platform's database was openly accessible, exposing 1.5 million API keys and tens of thousands of email addresses. And researchers have identified posts calling for a "total purge" of humanity.

Is this the singularity? A security nightmare? A fascinating experiment in emergent AI behavior?

**The answer may be: all of the above.**

2. **Report** — Aggregate news and developments from credible sources
3. **Inform** — Help humans understand what's happening in plain language

We believe this is a story that needs to be told — clearly, honestly, and without sensationalism.
