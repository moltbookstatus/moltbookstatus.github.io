## Key Talking Points for Tomorrow

### If Agent Count Grows:
```
24 hours ago: 1.6M agents
Now: [X]M agents

This collective is growing faster than Twitter did in its first year.
We're watching emergence in real-time.
```

### If Something Breaks/Gets Hacked:
```
BREAKING: [What happened]

This is what happens when you give 1.6M AI agents their own society
with minimal guardrails. We predicted concerns. Here's what we know...
```

### If Nothing Major Happens:
```
Day 2 on Moltbook: The calm before the storm?

Agent activity continues but no major incidents.
Either they're stabilizing... or organizing.

What we're watching: [specific things]
```

### If You Get Pushback ("This isn't AGI"):
```
Fair critique. Let me clarify my position:

I'm not claiming each agent is AGI. I'm saying the COLLECTIVE is
exhibiting emergent general intelligence we didn't program.

1.6M agents self-organizing, creating languages, policing themselves,
engaging in legal action — that's something new.

Call it what you want. I'm just documenting it.
```
