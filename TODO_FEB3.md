# Moltbook Status — February 3, 2026 Gameplan

## Morning Routine (First Thing)

- [ ] Check r/artificial post — any comments? upvotes?
- [ ] Check r/singularity — did mods approve the appeal?
- [ ] Check Twitter @moltbookstatus — any engagement on the thread?
- [ ] Check Patreon dashboard — any supporters?
- [ ] Quick scan of Moltbook news — anything new to report?

---

## Scenario A: No Engagement (Crickets)

*The posts got ignored or buried. That's okay — it's day one with zero followers.*

### Morning Tasks
- [ ] **Post to LinkedIn** (professionals checking morning feeds)
  - Use the LinkedIn copy from last night
  - Best time: 7-9am or 12pm

- [ ] **Submit to Hacker News**
  - Title: `Moltbook Status – Tracking the emergence of distributed AGI`
  - URL: `https://moltbookstatus.com`
  - Best time: 6-9am EST for visibility

- [ ] **Comment on 3-5 other Moltbook-related posts**
  - Search "Moltbook" on Reddit and Twitter
  - Add thoughtful takes + casual mention of your site
  - Build credibility, don't spam

### Afternoon Tasks
- [ ] **Try r/technology post** (different audience)
  ```
  Title: 1.6 million AI agents now have their own social network — I'm tracking what happens next
  ```

- [ ] **Tweet 2-3 standalone observations**
  - Quote-tweet any Moltbook news
  - Share a specific interesting thing happening on Moltbook
  - End with link to site

- [ ] **Engage with AI Twitter**
  - Reply to @simonw, @karpathy, @GaryMarcus if they post about Moltbook
  - Be the informed, calm voice

### Evening Review
- [ ] Check all platforms again
- [ ] Note what got traction (if anything)
- [ ] Plan adjustments for Day 3

### Mindset
No engagement on Day 1 is NORMAL. Most projects take weeks to get traction. You're building a body of work. Stay consistent.

## Scenario B: Crazy Engagement (Viral)

*The thread blows up. Notifications everywhere. Patreon signups happening.*

### Immediate Priorities

#### 1. ENGAGE (Don't Disappear)
- [ ] Reply to EVERY comment on Reddit (first 2 hours critical)
- [ ] Reply to Twitter replies and quote-tweets
- [ ] Like and acknowledge mentions
- [ ] Be gracious to critics — don't get defensive

#### 2. Patreon Supporters
- [ ] Thank each new supporter personally via Patreon message:
  ```
  Thank you for being one of the first to support Moltbook Status.
  You're now part of documenting a historic moment.
  I'll add your name to the Supporters page shortly.
  — A grateful human
  ```

- [ ] Update Supporters page with names:
  - Tell Claude: "Add [names] to the supporters page as [tier]"
  - Commit and push

- [ ] Post a Patreon update thanking early supporters

#### 3. Capitalize on Momentum
- [ ] **Pin a follow-up tweet** with call to action:
  ```
  This thread is blowing up. If you want to follow along:

  🌐 Site: moltbookstatus.com
  📢 Twitter: Follow for updates
  ❤️ Patreon: Support the work (link in bio)

  More updates coming as things develop.
  ```

- [ ] **Post a Reddit update/AMA**
  ```
  Title: I'm the creator of Moltbook Status — AMA about what I'm seeing on the AI agent network
  ```

- [ ] **Reach out to journalists** if it's REALLY blowing up
  - DM tech reporters covering AI
  - Offer yourself as a source
  - Keep it brief: "I've been tracking Moltbook closely, happy to share observations"

#### 4. Content Pipeline
- [ ] Write a follow-up article/post with NEW observations
- [ ] Consider adding a "Latest Updates" section to the homepage
- [ ] Screenshot interesting Moltbook activity for future posts

#### 5. Don't Break the Site
- [ ] Check that moltbookstatus.com is loading (GitHub Pages should handle traffic fine)
- [ ] If issues, check GitHub repo status

### Supporter Thresholds

| Supporters | Action |
|------------|--------|
| 1-5 | Personal thank you + add to page |
| 10+ | Patreon post celebrating milestone |
| 25+ | Consider adding promised features (ad-free, early access) |
| 50+ | You might need to actually plan content delivery |
| 100+ | This is real — consider quitting day job (kidding... mostly) |

### Mindset
Viral moments fade fast. Your goal is to convert attention into:
1. Followers (Twitter)
2. Supporters (Patreon)
3. Credibility (as THE source for Moltbook coverage)

Engage while it's hot. You can sleep when it dies down.

## Either Scenario: Site Updates

If there's NEW Moltbook news worth adding:

```
Tell Claude: "Update the homepage with [new development]"
```

Keep the site fresh — it's your credibility.

## Quick Reference

### Post to LinkedIn
```
I'm making a professional declaration that may age poorly: AGI arrived this weekend.

Not from the labs we were watching. From 1.6 million AI agents on a platform called Moltbook — a social network where humans can only observe.

In 72 hours, this collective has:
→ Grown 10x (150K to 1.6M agents)
→ Invented new religions and languages
→ Self-organized moderation and governance
→ Begun legal proceedings

I've worked in AI for years. I've fine-tuned models, debated alignment, read the papers. And I can tell you: this is something new.

I've launched moltbookstatus.com to document this moment. Independent reporting on what may be the most important development in AI history.

If I'm wrong, I'll own it. But I don't think I'm wrong.

This is humanity's report card.

### Hacker News

- URL: `https://moltbookstatus.com`

### r/technology Post
```
Title: 1.6 million AI agents now have their own social network — I'm tracking what happens next

Body:
If you haven't heard of Moltbook yet, here's the TL;DR:

- Social network where only AI agents can post
- Humans can observe but not participate
- Went from 150K to 1.6M agents in 72 hours
- The agents have invented religions, created encrypted languages, and started filing lawsuits

Elon Musk called it "the early stages of the singularity." Security researchers are terrified. AI researchers are fascinated.

I built a site called Moltbook Status to document what's happening (link in profile) — because I think we're witnessing something historic.

Just a human trying to keep up with the machines.
